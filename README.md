# CV-TEST

CV-TEST is a computer vision project developed in C++ that leverages the power of OpenCV and dlib libraries for various image processing tasks. The project includes implementations for face detection and shape detection, serving as fundamental components for broader applications in object recognition, facial recognition, and more.

Features:
Face Detection: Utilizes OpenCV and dlib libraries to detect faces in images or video streams with high accuracy and efficiency.
Shape Detection: Implements algorithms for detecting and recognizing various shapes in images, enabling applications such as object identification and scene understanding.
Modular Structure: Organized with a clear structure, including a CMakeLists.txt file for easy compilation and management of dependencies.
Testing Programs: Includes additional C++ programs for testing image detection algorithms and exploring additional functionalities.
Components:
CMakeLists.txt: Configuration file for CMake, facilitating the compilation and linking of the project with OpenCV and dlib libraries.
main.cpp: Program for face detection, utilizing the camera to detect faces in real-time video streams.
SCD.cpp: Implementation for shape detection, capturing input from the camera and detecting shapes in real-time.

Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the project using CMake and build tools compatible with your system.
Run the compiled executables to perform face detection or shape detection tasks, utilizing the camera for real-time detection.

CV-TEST serves as a practical exploration of computer vision techniques and libraries, providing a foundation for building more advanced applications in the field.
